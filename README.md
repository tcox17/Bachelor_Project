**Data Resources** <br /> 
We have obtained datasets from FiveThirtyEight and Kaggle containing contestant information from past seasons of "The Bachelor" and "The Bachelorette". The FiveThirtyEight dataset contains contestant names, weekly elimination/rose data, and weekly date data for seasons 1-13 of "The Bachelorette" and seasons 1-21 of "The Bachelor". The Kaggle dataset contains contestant names, ages, hometowns & weeks of elimination for seasons 1-12 of "The Bachelorette" and seasons 1, 2, 5 & 9-21 of "The Bachelor". The Kaggle dataset also contains the name, age & hometown of show leads for those same seasons. We may also compile further data from more recent seasons to utilize as test data for our models.
