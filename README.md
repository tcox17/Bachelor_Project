**Introduction to Problem or Opportunity** <br /> 
The Bachelor Franchise is one of the largest TV franchises across the globe with over 5 million viewers every week. This has created a community of those who watch the Bachelor, Bachelorette, and Bachelor in Paradise who enjoy exploring the data surrounding people on the show, their growing popularity, and applying predictive analytics to foresee the winners of each season and how the public will react. So, what exactly impacts the winner of a custom engagement ring, $250,000, and popularity among pop culture. To win the above rewards, you must go through 10 weeks of dating the Bachelor/Bachelorette, receive a rose each week to continue the relationship, and receive one ‘Final Rose’ from the lead.

**Data Resources** <br /> 
We have obtained datasets from FiveThirtyEight and Kaggle containing contestant information from past seasons of "The Bachelor" and "The Bachelorette". The FiveThirtyEight dataset contains contestant names, weekly elimination/rose data, and weekly date data for seasons 1-13 of "The Bachelorette" and seasons 1-21 of "The Bachelor". The Kaggle dataset contains contestant names, ages, hometowns & weeks of elimination for seasons 1-12 of "The Bachelorette" and seasons 1, 2, 5 & 9-21 of "The Bachelor". The Kaggle dataset also contains the name, age & hometown of show leads for those same seasons. We may also compile further data from more recent seasons to utilize as test data for our models. <br />
