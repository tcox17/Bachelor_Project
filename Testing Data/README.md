## Testing Dataset

The testing data was created by web scraping for all necessary data on Season 17 and 18; the two most recent season.

* **Season 17** stars Katie Thurston and ran from June 7, 2021 - August 9, 2021. This season will allow us to test our model with a full testing set using the most recent data from the most recent season. We will be able to run our full model and guage accuracy on a full season.

* **Season 18** stars Michelle Young and premiered on October 19, 2021. This season is expected to run through January of 2022, so we will not be able to complete a full model during the project window. This data allows our model to have a live, week by week prediction and improvement techniques in real time.

Following the CRISP-DM process, we will evaluate our model on Katie's season and deploy the model on Michelle's season.
